## write down the purpose of the above command
## ----|First, I changed the "sex" variable to a two-level factor (male, 
#female). Then, I created a new table for the new factor "sex" and the 
#previously created "Pain_long". This was done to narrow down the items I 
#would need to create a clustered barplot. Next, I created a barplot based 
#upon the table and labeled the axes. Next, I changed the colors to blue 
#(representing male) and pink (female). I used the line "beside=TRUE" because 
#I wanted the graph to read easier when comparing the quantity of reports for 
#each pain intensity rating.

# Joann Seunarine

# In trying to attempt to learn a new code that might have helped with
# me the homework but did not work, i learned about the EXCEPT function. 
# tryExcept(expr, except = { }, error = function(e) { }) is used for errors; 
# evaluates an expression, and if the expression raises an error it then 
# evaluates a second expression. I also learned that ! the Logical NOT operator
# this operator takes each element of the vector and gives the opposite logical
# value. I also learned that %>% is a combination of two operators. %% gives 
# the remainder of the first vector with the second, > checks if each element 
# of the first vector is greater than the corresponding element of the second 
# vector

## Min Lu: tryExcept is from package {infix}. I recommend tryCatch from {base} R
## how to give error in r
## mimic an error: after an error, the rest of the code won't be implemented
for (i in 1:10) {
  print(i)
  if (i==7) stop("Urgh, the iphone is in the blender !")
}

## after an error, the rest of the code will still be implemented
for (i in 1:10) {
  tryCatch({
    print(i)
    if (i==7) stop("Urgh, the iphone is in the blender !")
  }, error=function(e){cat("ERROR :",conditionMessage(e), "\n")})
}

## Min Lu: %>% alone is a operater that passing its left as the first argument to its right function
